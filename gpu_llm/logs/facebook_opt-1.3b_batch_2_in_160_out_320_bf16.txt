The research group is currently working on a project to develop a new architecture for the next generation of supercomputers. The project is called "Supercomputing Architecture for the Next Generation of Supercomputers" (SCAN). The project is a collaboration between the VIA research group and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The project is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy (DOE).

The project is a multi-disciplinary effort involving researchers from the VIA research group, NIST, and the University of California, Berkeley. The project is being led by Dr. Lee Young-Kwon, a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at KAIST.
