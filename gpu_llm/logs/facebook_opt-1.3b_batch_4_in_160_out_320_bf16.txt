The research group is currently working on a project to develop a new architecture for the next generation of supercomputers. The project is called "Supercomputing Architecture for the Next Generation of Supercomputers" (SCAN). The project is a collaboration between the VIA research group and the University of California, Berkeley. The project is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy (DOE).

The project is divided into three major parts:

1. The architecture of the next generation of supercomputers.

2. The architecture of the next generation of supercomputers.

3. The architecture of the next generation of supercomputers.

The architecture of the next generation of supercomputers is a key issue in the development of supercomputers. The architecture of the next generation of supercomputers is the key to the success of the supercomputing industry.
