The research group is currently working on a project to develop a new architecture for the next generation of supercomputers. The project is called "Supercomputing Architecture for the Next Generation of Supercomputers" (SCAN). The project is a collaboration between KAIST, the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Tokyo. The project is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).

The project is divided into three major areas:

1. The architecture of the next generation of supercomputers.

2. The architecture of the next generation of supercomputers.

3. The architecture of the next generation of supercomputers.

The architecture of the next generation of supercomputers is a key issue in the development of supercomputers.
